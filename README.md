# Techtalk

## How does it work?

#### Everyday, one of the juniors chooses a topic with regards to web development. The juniors then gives a presentation about the topic. After the presentation, there will be a feedback session. 

Now it's up to **you**!

To make everything run *smoothly*, the juniors ~(you)~ are responsible for maintaining the agenda.md.
Remember, there should be a techtalk every day!
